Sequence Models and Long Short Term Memory Networks

This project is to understand the basics of an LSTM network.

This guide will follow pytorch beginner tutorial [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html)

As well as a look into the Pytorch LSTM layer following this [guide](https://github.com/gabrielloye/LSTM_Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/LSTM_starter.ipynb)

This guide will discuss
