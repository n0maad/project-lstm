# project-lstm
Before beginning this project please review LSTM_starter either in this repository or [here](https://github.com/gabrielloye/LSTM_Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/LSTM_starter.ipynb)

Basics of an LSTM - This is where all the magic begins.
Amazon review data can be obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews). 
FYI an account has to be created to access the data.

This project is to obtain the basic understand of how an LSTM is formed using movie reviews.
The LSTM will determine if the reviews are either positive or negative.

In this project you will learn how to:
    Import data from a zip file             - Bz2
    Decode the data into utf-8 format       - x.decode()
    Split data up into x elements           - x.splt()
    Clean data by amending it               - re.sub()
    Use the National Language Tool Kit
    Prepare data for using on TensorDataset and DataLoader
    How to select CPU/GPU device for processing
    Aspects of the LSTM class
    How to train and evaluate the model.

All code used in this project was obtained [here](https://github.com/gabrielloye/LSTM_Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/main.ipynb)
